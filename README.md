## :scroll: Description
It's a dancer for 15 seconds and nothing else!


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I would like to learn more on JetpackCompose and improve in this new paradigm to me.
I learnt that exist a CountDownTimer but I'm not sure to have used the live data correctly.
If anyone will read this thing and know well livedata, please give me advice!
